# Coding Questions and Solutions in Kotlin.
Here I share a collection of programming questions with solutions. These are the solutions I could come up with, beauty and afficiency aren't guaranteed. 
<br> I hope this'll be useful for people like me learning to solve similar riddles, picking up a few tricks along the way.
<br>
Please try not to look at my solutions before having came up with your own. <br>
Don't submit my solution anywhere as your own (though I'd be surprised if you did). <br>

These examples are only for demonstration and learning purposes aiming improving algorithmic thinking and Kotlin programming skills.

# Coding Interview Questions and Solutions in Kotlin.
I share a collection of programming questions with solutions - not necessary from interviews. There're the solutions I could come up with, so beauty and afficiency aren't always guaranteed. :) 
<br> I hope this'll be useful to people like me learning to solve similar tasks, picking up a few tricks along the way.
<br>
Please don't look at my solutions before coming up with your own. <br>
Don't submit my solution anywhere as your own (though I'd be surprised). <br>

These examples are only for demonstration and learning purposes aiming improving algorithmic thinking and Kotlin programming skills.
